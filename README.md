### Keep any databases in sync — live, across engines.

Connect your databases, draw a **bridge** from a source to one or more
destinations, and Data Bridge keeps them in sync: the moment a row changes in the
source, it's written to every destination you linked. Any engine to any engine —
**PostgreSQL · MySQL/MariaDB · SQLite · MongoDB · Redis** — plus HTTP endpoints
when you need them.

<sub>A bridge is just: a source → one or more destinations → kept in sync.</sub>

</div>

---

## What it does

A **bridge** reads rows from a source database and writes each one to its
**destinations**. A destination is either:

- **another database** — the headline feature. Sync Postgres → MongoDB,
  MySQL → SQLite, MongoDB → Redis… mix engines freely. One bridge can fan out to
  **several databases at once**, and bridges can chain (DB&nbsp;A → DB&nbsp;B → DB&nbsp;C).
- **an HTTP endpoint** — POST/PUT/PATCH each row to a URL with a payload you
  design, for the times you're feeding a service instead of a database.

What makes the database-to-database sync trustworthy:

- **Any engine → any engine.** The same bridge moves a row between relational,
  document, and key-value stores. Values are translated to fit the target.
- **No duplicates, ever.** Writes are **idempotent upserts** keyed by the columns
  you choose, so replays, retries, and redeliveries never double-write. Inserts,
  updates, **and deletes** all propagate.
- **Missing table? Auto-create it.** If the destination table/collection doesn't
  exist, Data Bridge creates it from the source's shape (with cross-engine type
  translation). Or **map and rename columns** yourself — "write this column into
  that column over there."
- **Live, polled, or one-shot** — you pick how it fires (see triggers below).

### How a bridge fires

- **Replay** — a one-shot job. Stream all (or selected) rows once, then finish.
  Perfect for the **initial backfill** or a migration.
- **Watch** — poll the source on a cursor (an auto-increment id, an `updated_at`
  column, or a primary-key diff) and sync new rows as they show up. Works on
  every engine.
- **CDC** — true change-data-capture straight from the database's change log, in
  **real time, no polling**. Postgres logical replication, MySQL binlog, MongoDB
  change streams, Redis keyspace notifications. Inserts, updates, and deletes all
  come through, each tagged with its operation.

The rest is the same whichever destination and trigger you pick:

- **Build it visually.** Browse the source table, toggle the columns to send,
  pick destinations, and watch a live preview of exactly what will be written.
- **Map or shape the data.** For a database target, map source → target columns
  (rename, drop, pick keys). For an HTTP target, use a safe token template —
  `{{column}}`, `{{$row}}`, `{{$table}}`, `{{$op}}`, `{{$now}}`, `{{$index}}`.
  Structured substitution only — no string injection, no code execution.
- **Sync reliably.** Retries with backoff, rate limiting, optional batching, and
  exactly-once delivery so a change is applied once and only once downstream.
- **Watch it happen.** A live timeline colours every delivery green (synced) ·
  red (failed) · amber (skipped) · slate (queued). Click any cell for the exact
  row written, the result, timing, and any error.
- **Stay in control.** Runs survive restarts, resume where they stopped, and can
  be cancelled. Skip rows by range or selection, or retry only the failed ones in
  place — failed cells flip green.

## Get started

You'll need **Node 22+**, **pnpm 10+**, and **Docker**. The repo pins both via
`.nvmrc` and `packageManager`, so the easiest setup is:

```bash
nvm use            # picks up Node 22 from .nvmrc (or just use Node 22+ yourself)
corepack enable    # gives you the exact pnpm version the repo expects
```

Then:

```bash
pnpm install                  # frontend + backend
docker compose up -d          # postgres (metadata) + redis (job queue)
pnpm start                    # initialize and run the whole app
```

`pnpm start` does the boring parts for you: it writes the local env files,
builds the workspace, runs the database migrations, then launches both the API
and the web app.

```
  Data Bridge · ready

    Web  http://localhost:3002   ← open this
    API  http://localhost:4002/api
```

Working on the code? `pnpm dev` is the same thing in watch mode.

> **Install trouble?** `better-sqlite3` is the only dependency that needs a
> native binary. On Node 22+ it installs a prebuilt one — no compiler needed.
> If you see it fall back to `node-gyp` (or a `tsc: command not found` right
> after, which just means the install bailed early), you're usually on a Node
> version without a prebuild or a distro-packaged pnpm with a broken node-gyp.
> Fix: use Node 22+ (`nvm use`), get pnpm via `corepack enable` instead of your
> system package manager, then `pnpm install` again.

> The two services back different things. **Postgres** holds Data Bridge's own
> metadata (saved connections, hooks, runs, deliveries) through Prisma.
> **Redis** backs the BullMQ queue that runs hooks durably. Connecting
> databases, browsing data, and building/previewing hooks all work without
> Redis — only _running_ a hook needs it. Point `DATABASE_URL` / `REDIS_URL` at
> your own instances if you'd rather not use the bundled containers.

## The bridge lifecycle

1. **Connect** your databases (credentials encrypted at rest) from the Data
   sources workbench, or inline while building a bridge.
2. **Create a bridge** — pick the source table and columns, then choose where it
   syncs: one or more **target databases** (map columns or let it auto-create the
   table) and/or an **HTTP endpoint**. Pick a trigger (replay / watch / CDC). For
   CDC the builder runs a readiness check and tells you exactly what (if anything)
   the source still needs configured.
3. **Run / listen** — a replay job streams rows once with the timeline updating
   live; a watch or CDC bridge starts listening and syncs changes as they happen.
4. **React** — skip rows you don't want, cancel, resume the remainder, or retry
   the failures after fixing a destination. Edits apply on the next run/resume.

## Source data, when you need it

Data Bridge ships a full database workbench (the "Data sources" surface) — handy
for shaping a source and for inspecting what landed in a destination:

- Browse any table — paginated, sortable, multi-condition filters, inline edit,
  insert/delete, CSV/JSON export.
- A Monaco query editor with tabs, autocomplete, and formatting.
- Schema explorer, structure view, interactive ER diagram, and full DDL
  (create/drop/truncate tables, create/drop databases).
- Backup & restore — portable JSON for any engine, or `.sql` for relational ones.

Every table view has a one-click "Create bridge" that drops you into the builder
pre-seeded with that table as the source.

## How it's built

A pnpm monorepo with a one-way dependency flow (`web → api → core`):

```
data-bridge/
├─ packages/
│  └─ core/            @data-bridge/core — framework-agnostic domain (pure TS)
│     ├─ adapters/       DatabaseAdapter interface + one file per engine
│     │                  (raw drivers: pg, mysql2, better-sqlite3, mongodb, ioredis)
│     └─ hooks/          column mapping + cross-engine table translation,
│                        payload transform, shared bridge schemas (Zod)
├─ apps/
│  ├─ api/             @data-bridge/api — NestJS backend
│  │  ├─ hooks/          bridge store · run processor · CDC providers ·
│  │  │                  sink router → database sink + HTTP delivery
│  │  ├─ connections/    Prisma-backed store · live adapter pool · controllers
│  │  ├─ common/         crypto · Zod validation · exception filter
│  │  └─ prisma/         metadata-store schema + migrations
│  └─ web/             @data-bridge/web — Next.js 15 frontend (shadcn/ui, TanStack)
└─ docker-compose.yml  Postgres (metadata) + Redis (run queue)
```

**One sink, two destination kinds.** Every trigger (replay, watch, CDC) funnels
rows through a single sink router. It dispatches to the **database sink** (which
maps columns, auto-creates the target if needed, and performs a native upsert or
keyed delete on the target engine) or to **HTTP delivery** (template render +
POST with retries). The runner, monitor, and exactly-once accounting don't care
which — so a new destination is one module.

**Exactly-once, cross-engine.** Database targets write with the engine's own
atomic upsert — Postgres/SQLite `ON CONFLICT`, MySQL `ON DUPLICATE KEY`, Mongo
`updateOne(upsert)` — keyed by the columns you chose. That makes every write
idempotent: replays and at-least-once CDC redeliveries land a row once. Deletes
route to a keyed delete on each target.

**Durable runs.** A replay run is one BullMQ job (`jobId = runId`). It streams
the source a page at a time (keyset pagination for millions of rows), syncs
sequentially (natural backpressure), and checkpoints progress — so a crash
auto-resumes from where it left off.

**CDC behind one interface.** Each engine captures changes its own way, but they
all implement the same small `CdcProvider` contract (readiness, provision,
stream, cursor). The service around them handles the run lifecycle and the
shared dedupe → map → write → record → checkpoint pipeline, so adding a new
engine's CDC is a single file.

**Two data layers, two right tools.** The databases you connect _to_ have
unknown, runtime-discovered schemas, so the adapters use raw drivers with fully
parameterized queries (an ORM can't introspect arbitrary schemas). Data Bridge's
_own_ store has a fixed schema we control, so it uses Prisma with migrations.

> Adding an engine = implement `DatabaseAdapter` and register it. The connection
> form, schema browser, and feature gating all derive from that one registration.

## Configuration

Env files are created automatically on first run from the committed
`*.env.example` files. The essentials:

| Variable                      | Where | Purpose                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`                        | api   | API port (default `4002`)                    |
| `WEB_PORT`                    | web   | Web port (default `3002`)                    |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`         | web   | Base URL of the API                          |
| `DATABASE_URL`                | api   | Postgres datasource for the metadata store   |
| `REDIS_URL`                   | api   | Redis backing the bridge-run queue           |
| `DATABRIDGE_MASTER_KEY`       | api   | base64 32-byte key for secret encryption     |
| `DATABRIDGE_HOOK_CONCURRENCY` | api   | How many bridge runs may execute in parallel |
| `WEB_ORIGIN`                  | api   | CORS origin (defaults to any in dev)         |

If `DATABRIDGE_MASTER_KEY` is unset, a random key is generated under
`apps/api/.data-bridge/` on first run — set it explicitly in production.

## CDC prerequisites

Replay and watch bridges work anywhere. CDC needs the **source** database
configured for change capture; the builder's readiness panel checks all of this
for you and spells out what's missing.

| Engine     | Mechanism              | What it needs                                                                                               |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PostgreSQL | logical replication    | `wal_level=logical`, a role with REPLICATION (slot/publication auto-made)                                   |
| MySQL      | binary log             | `log_bin=ON`, `binlog_format=ROW`, `binlog_row_image=FULL`, REPLICATION grants                              |
| MongoDB    | change streams         | a replica set (a single-node one is fine for dev); pre-images auto-enabled so deletes propagate by your key |
| Redis      | keyspace notifications | `notify-keyspace-events` (Data Bridge enables it when it can)                                               |
| SQLite     | —                      | not supported; use a watch hook instead                                                                     |

> Redis CDC is real-time only and non-durable — events that happen while Data
> Bridge is offline can't be recovered, so prefer a watch hook there if you need
> guarantees.

## Security

- Connection passwords and hook auth secrets are encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM)
  and only ever returned to the browser redacted.
- All user values are passed as bound parameters; identifiers are dialect-quoted.
- Hook payloads are built by structured token substitution — no string injection,
  no code execution.
- Data Bridge runs locally with no auth layer. Add authentication, and restrict
  which destinations (database connections / endpoint URLs) a bridge may write
  to, before exposing it to an untrusted network.
